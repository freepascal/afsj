not a good idea to start comparing your new partner with your old partner. Do not find reasons to find something wrong with your new partner simply because you are afraid that the new relationship will also fail. Embrace the new relationship with an open-mind and optimism.

Moving forward sounds easier said than done, but you owe it to yourself to love and be loved again. You should not have the mentality that the next relationship will end in despair. Enter the new relationship with an open mind and heart. Remember, a new relationship is a new beginning.
